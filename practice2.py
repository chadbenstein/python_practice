#Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and then their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old

#Extra Credit
#1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message (Hint: order of operations exists in Pythong).
#2. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines ("Hint: the string \n is the same thing as pressing the ENTER button")

#user_name = raw_input("What is your name?: ")
#user_years = int(raw_input("Hi " + user_name + ". How old are you?: "))
#user_request = int(raw_input("How many times do you want your super awesome message to print?: "))
#century = 100

#def century_year(current_year):
#    years_until_century = century - user_years
#    print (user_request)*("Alright " + user_name + ". You'll be 100 years old in " + str(years_until_century) + " years. The year will be " ((current_year) + (years_until_century)) + "! /n")
#    return
#century_year(2017)
